## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your Discord Music Bot up and running on your Linux server.

### üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Node.js (LTS version recommended):**
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install nodejs npm
    ```
* **`ffmpeg`:** Essential for audio processing.
    ```bash
    sudo apt install ffmpeg
    ```
* **`libsodium-wrappers` (or `opus`):** Required for voice connections. The `package.json` already lists `libsodium-wrappers`.
    ```bash
    sudo apt install libsodium-dev # For Debian/Ubuntu
    # Or, if using opus:
    # sudo apt install libopus-dev
    ```

### üîë Obtaining Tokens and IDs

You'll need the following credentials:

1.  **Discord Bot Token:**
    * Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
    * Create a new application or select an existing one.
    * Navigate to "Bot" on the left sidebar.
    * Click "Add Bot" and then "Yes, do it!".
    * Copy the token. **Keep this token private!**
    * Under "Privileged Gateway Intents," enable **MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT**.

2.  **Discord Bot Owner ID:**
    * In Discord, go to `User Settings` -> `Advanced` and enable `Developer Mode`.
    * Right-click on your user profile in Discord and select `Copy ID`.

3.  **Discord DJ Role ID (Optional):**
    * If you want to restrict certain commands to a "DJ" role, create a role in your Discord server named "DJ" (or whatever you prefer).
    * Right-click on the "DJ" role in your server settings and select `Copy ID`.

4.  **Spotify API Credentials (Client ID & Client Secret):**
    * Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).
    * Log in and click "Create an App".
    * Fill in the details. The "Redirect URI" can be anything, as we're using the Client Credentials Flow (e.g., `http://localhost`).
    * Once created, you'll see your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`. Copy both.

### üì¶ Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
